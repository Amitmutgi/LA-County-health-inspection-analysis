# la county_health_inspection_analysis

The city of Los Angeles publishes data on Environment Health inspection and enforcement results from restaurants in the Los Angeles county. These data cover 85 of 88 cities and all unincorporated areas in the LA county.

There are two datasets available: (i) market inspection dataset: contains results of inspection; and (ii) market violations dataset: contains information on health code violations in restaurants. These data were last updated on January 16, 2019. Data dictionaries for the above two data sets are included below. Feel free to supplement the above information with other publicly-available information.

We are interested in understanding the following questions:

(1) What are the key factors in predicting health “scores” of the restaurants in Los Angeles county? 

(2) What are the most important factors in classifying restaurants into different “grades”?

(3) Are there any relationships between various types of health code violations and scores/grades of a restaurant?

(4) Are there any patterns in terms of how health scores of restaurants change over time?
